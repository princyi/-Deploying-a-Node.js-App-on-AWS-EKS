# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
# Level: Beginner-to-Intermediate
# AWS EKS while introducing intermediate-level concepts like Docker, Kubernetes manifests, and CI/CD.

This project is beginner-friendly as it covers the fundamentals of setting up and deploying an application on AWS EKS while introducing intermediate-level concepts like Docker, Kubernetes manifests, and CI/CD.

Project Objective
Deploy a simple Node.js web application on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), expose it to the internet using a LoadBalancer, and automate deployment using GitHub Actions.

# AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a powerful solution for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes in the cloud. Below is a guide to creating an AWS EKS project, including steps and components involved:
Use Case Examples for an AWS EKS Project
Microservices Architecture: Deploy and manage a set of containerized microservices.
CI/CD Pipeline: Automate deployments for Kubernetes applications.
Data Processing: Use Kubernetes to process large data workloads with tools like Spark.
Multi-Region Cluster Setup: Build a resilient, multi-region Kubernetes architecture.
